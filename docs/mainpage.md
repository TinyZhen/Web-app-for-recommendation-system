# Web Recommender System
The **Web Recommender System** is a full-stack, AI-powered movie recommendation
platform designed to provide **personalized and explainable movie suggestions**
based on user preferences. The system integrates modern web technologies with
large language model–based reasoning to deliver recommendations that are not
only accurate, but also transparent and fairness-aware.

Users interact with the system through a guided survey, rate movies they have
seen, and receive ranked recommendations accompanied by natural-language
explanations. The platform supports user authentication, profile management,
saved recommendations, and social sharing, creating a complete end-to-end
recommendation experience.

The application is built using a modular architecture that cleanly separates
frontend presentation, backend recommendation logic, and data management,
making it easy to extend, maintain, and document.
